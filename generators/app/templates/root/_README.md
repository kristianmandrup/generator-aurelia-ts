TypeScript project
------------------

We recommend using [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/)

Use `apm` the Atom package manager to install the [atom-typescript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript#atom-typescript) plugin:

`apm install atom-typescript`

A basic [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/tsconfig.md) file is generated by the generator, which you can customize as you like...

### Getting Started

[TypeScript site](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

See the guide [Aurelia Typescript for Atom](https://github.com/cmichaelgraham/aurelia-typescript-atom)

-	Make sure you are in the root of your generated project.
-	Start the Atom IDE: `atom .`
-	Build `.ts` files (either `<F6>` or run `gulp build`\)
-	Run `gulp watch`
-	Open Chrome
-	Visit: `localhost:9000`

Tasks
-----

The following npm tasks are available:

-	`npm test` : Run Tests
-	`npm build` : Build
-	`npm start` : Start server
-	`npm run watch` : Watch files and build on change
-	`npm run ts-build` : Build TypeScript files

CSS Preprocessing tasks
-----------------------

-	`gulp css:build` build css from CSS lang extension files (Stylus, Sass)
-	`gulp css:watch` watch CSS lang extension files and build on change

These builds will result in css files which will be dumped in `styles/css` which is being watched by `gulp watch`. Hence they will result in a new distribution build and browser sync reload.

Extra goodies for Stylus
------------------------

For Stylus, the following Stylus extension libraries are included in order to greatly improve Stylus based styling.

-	[Nib](https://github.com/tj/nib) and [screencast](http://www.screenr.com/M6a)
-	[Axis](http://axis.netlify.com/)
-	[Rupture](http://jenius.github.io/rupture/) nice "break points" ;)
-	[Fluidity](www.fluiditycss.com)
-	[Jeet](http://jeet.gs/) super awesome framework!

With these libraries, it should in large part be unnecessary to add presentational classes to your HTML, keeping it clean and ensuring true decoupling of your document structure from presentational logic.

Build TypeScript files
----------------------

The ts-gulpfile is a custom gulp file for use with TypeScript. It includes a task `build-ts` to auto build typescript definitions.

To use it: `npm run ts-build`

Troubleshooting
---------------

If for any reason your app is not served correctly, Make sure

-	you have all your jspm dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. Run `jspm install`.
-	you have an entry for the UI framework you have chosen.
-	you have run `gulp build` and have a `/build` folder populated with `js` and `html` files.
-	If you are using Semantic-UI, you have run `npm run sem-build`
-	If you are using a CSS lang extension (Stylus or Sass) you have run `gulp css:build` or `gulp styles:watch`

```json
  "jspm": {
    "dependencies": {
      "aurelia-animator-css": "github:aurelia/animator-css@^0.13.0",
      ...
      "aurelia-templating-router": "github:aurelia/templating-router@^0.14.0",
      "css": "github:systemjs/plugin-css@^0.1.9",
      "font-awesome": "npm:font-awesome@^4.3.0",
      "semantic-ui": "github:Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI@^2.0.7"
